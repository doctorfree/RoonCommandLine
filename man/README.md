# RoonCommandLine/man

This directory contains automatically generated man format output files
generated by pandoc using the utility script
[md2man](https://gitlab.com/doctorfree/DoctorFreeScripts/-/blob/master/scripts/md2man.sh)
in the [DoctorFreeScripts repository](https://gitlab.com/doctorfree/DoctorFreeScripts)
is used as a pandoc wrapper.

The man page format output can be found at ./man?/<command>.?
and corresponding markdown input at ../markdown/<command>.?.md

For example, the man page output for the `roon` command would be found at
./man1/roon.1 and the corresponding markdown input used to generate the
roon man page would be found at ../markdown/roon.1.md
