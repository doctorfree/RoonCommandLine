.SH NAME
.PP
set_zone - Set the default Roon playback Zone
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]set_zone\f[R] [ ZONE ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Sets the default Roon playback zone.
Current playback, if active, is unaffected.
Subsequent Roon commands, if no zone is specified on the command line,
will take effect in the specified default Roon zone.
If the Roon zone specified on the command line does not match a
configured Roon zone exactly then the first Roon zone name containing
the \f[I]ZONE\f[R] substring will be set as the default Roon zone.
.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
.TP
\f[B]ZONE\f[R]
Set the default Roon playback zone to \f[I]ZONE\f[R]
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
\f[B]set_zone HomePod\f[R]
Will set the default Roon zone to \[dq]HomePod\[dq] if a zone by that
name exists.
If no zone named \[dq]HomePod\[dq] exists then Roon zones are searched
for a zone name containing the string \[dq]HomePod\[dq] and the first
matching Roon zone name is set as the default Roon zone.
