play_radio - Play Roon Live Radio
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]play_radio\f[R] [ RADIO ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Plays the Roon Live Radio channel named \f[I]RADIO\f[R].
If no Live Radio channel name matches \f[I]RADIO\f[R] exactly, search
for Roon Live Radio channels whose name contains the case-sensitive
string \f[I]RADIO\f[R].
If there is a unique match on the search substring then
\f[I]play_radio\f[R] will play that Live Radio channel.
If more than one Roon Live Radio channel name matches the search
substring then \f[I]play_radio\f[R] will return a list of matching Live
Radio channel names.
To play a Live Radio channel using the substring search facility, enough
of a substring must be supplied to uniquely match a Roon Live Radio
channel name.
