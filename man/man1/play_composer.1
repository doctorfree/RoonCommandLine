play_composer - Play Roon Library Composer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]play_composer\f[R] [ COMPOSER ] [ EXCOMPOSER ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Plays the Roon Library composer named \f[I]COMPOSER\f[R].
If no library composer name matches \f[I]COMPOSER\f[R] exactly, search
for Roon Library composer whose name contains the case-sensitive string
\f[I]COMPOSER\f[R].
If there is a match on the search substring then \f[I]play_composer\f[R]
will play that composer.
If more than one Roon Library composer name matches the search substring
then \f[I]play_composer\f[R] will return a list of matching composer
names.
.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
.TP
\f[B]COMPOSER\f[R]
