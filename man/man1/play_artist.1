.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]play_artist\f[R] Plays the Roon Library artist named
\f[I]ARTIST\f[R].
If no library artist name matches \f[I]ARTIST\f[R] exactly, search for
Roon Library artist whose name contains the case-sensitive string
\f[I]ARTIST\f[R].
If there is a unique match on the search substring then it will play
that artist.

then it will return a list of matching artist names.
To play an artist using the substring search facility, enough of a
substring must be supplied to uniquely match a Roon Library artist name.

containing the substring will be played if a unique match is found.
