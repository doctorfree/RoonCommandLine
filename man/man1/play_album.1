.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]play_album\f[R] [ ALBUM ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Plays the Roon Library album named \f[I]ALBUM\f[R].
If no library album name matches \f[I]ALBUM\f[R] exactly, search for
Roon Library albums whose name contains the case-sensitive string
\f[I]ALBUM\f[R].
If there is a unique match on the search substring then
\f[I]play_album\f[R] will play that album.
If more than one Roon Library album name matches the search substring
then \f[I]play_album\f[R] will return a list of matching album names.
To play an album using the substring search facility, enough of a
substring must be supplied to uniquely match a Roon Library album name.
