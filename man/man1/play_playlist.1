play_playlist - Play Roon Library Playlist
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]play_playlist\f[R] [ PLAYLIST ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Plays the Roon Library playlist named \f[I]PLAYLIST\f[R].
If no library playlist name matches \f[I]PLAYLIST\f[R] exactly, search
for Roon Library playlist whose name contains the case-sensitive string
\f[I]PLAYLIST\f[R].
If there is a unique match on the search substring then
\f[I]play_playlist\f[R] will play that playlist.
If more than one Roon Library playlist name matches the search substring
then \f[I]play_playlist\f[R] will return a list of matching playlist
names.
To play an playlist using the substring search facility, enough of a
substring must be supplied to uniquely match a Roon Library playlist
name.
.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
.TP
\f[B]PLAYLIST\f[R]
Provide an playlist name, in quotes if it contains spaces, or a

containing the substring will be played if a unique match is found.
.SH EXAMPLES

\f[B]play_playlist Mood\f[R]
Will play Roon library playlist name \[dq]Mood\[dq] if it exists.
If not then it will play the Roon library playlist whose name contains
the string \[dq]Mood\[dq] if only one match is found.
