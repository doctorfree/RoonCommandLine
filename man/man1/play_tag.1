play_tag - Play Roon Library Tag
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]play_tag\f[R] [ TAG ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Plays the Roon Library tag named \f[I]TAG\f[R].
If no library tag name matches \f[I]TAG\f[R] exactly, search for Roon
Library tag whose name contains the case-sensitive string \f[I]TAG\f[R].
If there is a unique match on the search substring then
\f[I]play_tag\f[R] will play that tag.
If more than one Roon Library tag name matches the search substring then
\f[I]play_tag\f[R] will return a list of matching tag names.
To play an tag using the substring search facility, enough of a
substring must be supplied to uniquely match a Roon Library tag name.
.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
.TP
\f[B]TAG\f[R]
Provide an tag name, in quotes if it contains spaces, or a
case-sensitive substring.
A Roon library tag name matching the provided tag name or containing the
substring will be played if a unique match is found.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
\f[B]play_tag Moon\f[R]
Will play Roon library tag name \[dq]Moon\[dq] if it exists.
If not then it will play the Roon library tag whose name contains the
string \[dq]Moon\[dq] if only one match is found.
