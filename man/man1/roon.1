.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[I]roon\f[R] command acts as a front-end for executing the
RoonCommandLine project commands to provide Command Line control of the
Roon Audio System over a local area network.
Roon Command Line commands utilize the Python Roon API to communicate
with the Roon Core.
.PP

.PP
In addition, search capabilities have been added to the scripts with
partial matching facilities.
Thus a substring can be supplied to use as a search term with partial
matching returning albums, artists, playlists, genres, or tags which
contain the specified substring (case sensitive).
The special search term \[dq]all\[dq] indicates match all albums,
artists, playlists, genres, or tags.
.PP
All commands and playback can target a specified Roon output zone.
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] No modifications are made to the Roon Core.
The RoonCommandLine package resides entirely on other systems within
your local area network.
.PP
Additional detail and info can be found in the RoonCommandLine
Wiki (https://gitlab.com/doctorfree/RoonCommandLine/-/wikis/home).

.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
Roon utilizes two configuration files,
\f[B]/usr/local/Roon/etc/pyroonconf\f[R] and
\f[B]/usr/local/Roon/etc/roon_api.ini\f[R]
.PP
Default settings are applied during the RoonCommandLine installation
process.
The primary area of post-installation configuration is setting the
ZONEGROUPS and DEFAULT values in the file
\f[B]/usr/local/Roon/etc/roon_api.ini\f[R].
The RoonCommandLine installation attempts to automate this configuration
and should have provided a good starting point with default settings in
\f[B]roon_api.ini\f[R] but you may wish to adjust these.
.PP
In Roon, you can view your existing zones by visiting
\f[B]Settings->Audio\f[R].
The names of the enabled audio devices are your zones.
You can change the name of a zone by clicking the \[dq]pencil\[dq] icon
next to the name in the Roon audio settings screen.
.PP
Modify \f[B]roon_api.ini\f[R] with your desired zone groupings and
default values.
In particular, set the \f[B]DefaultZone\f[R] value in the DEFAULT
section to a zone that will be available, enabled, and one you wish to
use as your primary default fallback zone.
The installation picked a DefaultZone for you and you may be satisfied
with that automatic setting.
.PP
Note, the DefaultZone setting is used when no zone is specified,
RoonCommandLine commands all accept a \f[B]-z zone\f[R] argument that
can be used to specify the zone to be used as well as a \f[B]-G \f[R]
that can be used to specify the zone grouping to use.
.PP
Note also that should you change the name of a Roon audio device in the
future then that name change will also need to be reflected in the
\f[B]roon_api.ini\f[R] groupings.
.PP
If you wish to enable remote exection of the RoonCommandLine tools then
it is necessary to setup SSH public key authentication.
The RoonCommandLine utilities can be executed locally on the same system
they are installed on by enabling local access with the \f[B]roon
-L\f[R] command.
This avoids the need to enable SSH public key authentication but
restricts your use of the RoonCommandLine tools to the system on which
they are installed.
