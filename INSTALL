Install the Python Roon API (pyrooon) on a system that has Python 3 and that
can access your Roon Core. To install the Python Roon API execute the command:
    pip install roonapi

The "roon" shell script is a frontend for the other scripts in this project.
It should be installed in the execution PATH on all systems from which remote
Roon command-line execution is desired. The systems on which "roon" is
installed must have SSH access to the system on which pyroon and accompanying
scripts are installed. Edit the "roon" script to set the IP address of your
Python Roon API server and the user name (these are the two variables near the
top of the file, "server" and "user"). Also edit the "zone" setting to the name
of a Roon Zone you wish to use for the default zone.

Copy all of the scripts in this directory to ~/bin on the system on which pyroon
is installed (cp *_* ~/bin).

Copy all of the Python scripts and the "roon_api.ini" configuration file in the
api subdirectory to ~/Roon on the system on which pyroon is installed
(cp api/*_* ~/Roon). Edit ~/Roon/roon_api.ini to set the default values and
Roon Core IP address.

A convenience installation script, ./install.sh, is provided. Running this script
on the system on which pyroon is installed will copy the Shell and Python scripts
to their appropriate locations.

No passwords are used in the SSH invocations in this project. It is assumed that
appropriate SSH Public Key Authentication has been configured for all systems
that will be using SSH to execute commands on the remote pyroon server.
