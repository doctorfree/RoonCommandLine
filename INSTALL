Install the Python Roon API (pyrooon) on a system that has Python 3 and that
can access your Roon Core. To install the Python Roon API execute the command:
    pip install roonapi

The "roon" shell script is a frontend for the other scripts in this project.
It should be installed in the execution PATH on all systems from which remote
Roon command-line execution is desired. The systems on which "roon" is
installed must have SSH access to the system on which pyroon and accompanying
scripts are installed.

Copy all of the scripts in this directory to ~/bin on the system on which pyroon
is installed (cp *_* ~/bin).

Copy all of the Pythong scripts in the api subdirectory to ~/Roon on the system
on which pyroon is installed (cp api/*_* ~/Roon).

No passwords are used in the SSH invocations in this project. It is assumed that
appropriate SSH Public Key Authentication has been configured for all systems
that will be using SSH to execute commands on the remote pyroon server.
